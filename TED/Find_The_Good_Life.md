# The Law of 33% #

[The Law of 33% by Tai Lopez at TEDxUBIWiltz Conference Transcript](https://singjupost.com/the-law-of-33-by-tai-lopez-at-tedxubiwiltz-conference-transcript/)

每个人都想过上好生活，但是，并不是每个人都能过上好生活，对吧？

Everybody wants the good life, but not everybody gets the good life, right?

1、寻找良师（Mentor）


良师，能够赋予于你copy能力的人，是你将来能够成功的预言者。正如毕加索所说：能工摹形，巧匠窃意。

Mentors – your ability to copy – is the biggest predictor of the success that you will have in life. As Picasso(毕加索) said, “Good artists copy, but great artists steal.” Right?

良师原则（Mentor Rules）。第一，将你时间的33%花费在那些不如你的人身上，帮助他们成长。

So I want to share with you some things that I’ve found, some specifics that you can do with mentors. The first rule is, I call it the Mentor Rules. It’s the Law of 33%. You should divide up your life and spend 33% of your time around people lower than you. You can mentor them, you can help them. And they’ll help you back by making you feel good about yourself. Right? It’s good to know somebody’s doing worse than you. That’s that 30%.

第二，将你时间的33%花费在那些和你同水平的人身上，成为彼此的朋友。

Then you have 33% of people that are on your level. These become your friends, your peers.

第三（也是最后），将你时间的33%花费在良师身上，让自己成长。但是，要注意的一点是，找良师，不要找那些只比你好一点点的人，因为那就像盲人给盲人领路一样（he blind leading the blind），对你的增益并不会很多。

But that last 33% is what most people forget about. Those are people 10, 20 years ahead of you. They’ll make you feel a little bit uncomfortable, but that’s what you want, and remember you don’t want to make the mistake most people make with mentors, finding somebody just a little bit better than them. You don’t want to be the blind leading the blind. 

10X原则（10X Rule）。找良师，要找那些比你好10倍的人做你的老师。如果你想运营一家100万的公司，那你就得找一个能够运营1000万公司的人做你的老师。

So I call it the 10X Rule; find somebody 10 times further ahead than you. If you want to learn how to grow a $1 million company, you have to find somebody who has a $10 million company. 

不要害怕接近那些比你好太多的良师。事实上，那些比你优秀太多的良师，会让你很吃惊，吃惊的原因是他们乐于与你接触，更进一步原因是他们记得自己过去时光里的那份struggle，他们想伸出手来帮助你。

Don’t be afraid to go to the top. In-person mentors are amazing. And you can get people like Warren Buffet, Bill Gates. You’d be surprised! My friend heard a talk. Frank, he’s a director in Hollywood. He’s like, “Tai, you won’t believe this. I heard your talk and I emailed some people. And Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal, the only man to own three companies worth $1 billion, he wrote me back and I had lunch with him. You’d be surprised, because people remember their struggle, and they’ll reach out and help you, too.

记住，每个人都想过好的生活，但并不是每个人都会遵循这些规则（良师原则、10X原则）。如果你真的想过好生活，那么遵循这些规则。

Remember, everybody wants the good life, but not everybody’s willing to follow these rules. You must follow these rules.

2、为人谦逊（Humility）

这里举了一个例子。Sam Walton（萨姆·沃尔顿），是一个企业家，沃尔玛的创始人。

One of my favorite stories in business, Sam Walton. He becomes the richest man in America. He starts Walmart, this big empire. And he takes a trip to São Paulo, Brazil. And when he’s there, his host family, his friends get a call from the police department. They’re like, “Come bail out Sam Walton. He’s in jail.” By this time, he’s an older guy. Billionaire. They rushed down. If you’ve ever seen the inside of a Brazilian jail cell, it’s not a good place for a 60-year-old billionaire. And they asked the police, “Are you crazy? Are you arresting him?” They’re like, “We didn’t know who he was, and we found him crawling around the floors of stores.”

Sam Walton（萨姆·沃尔顿）已经是一个百万富翁，或许你会认为他会很骄傲自大，事实却正好相反。每个人都想过上好生活，但并不是每个人都愿意（像Sam Walton那样）谦逊处事。

And they asked him what he was doing, and he’s like, “Oh, I was just taking a tape measurer and measuring how wide the aisles were because I was trying to figure out if these Brazilians knew something that I didn’t know.” Already a billionaire. You’d think he’d be cocky(狂妄自信的; 骄傲的，自大的;). You see, everybody wants the good life, but not everybody’s willing to be humble like Sam Walton was. You have to be humble.

3、懂得坚韧（Perseverance）

媒体会trick我们，只告诉我们最后的成功。Bill Gates说：从20岁到30岁，从没有休息过，哪怕一天也没有。我们也会学会坚韧，坚韧地寻找良师，坚韧地把事情做到实处。

The media has tricked us. They only show us the success at the end, but Bill Gates started at 12. It wasn’t until 31 years old that he was a billionaire. He said, “From age 20 to 30, I never took a day off. Not even one”. You must persevere, and in your search for mentors you must persevere, as well. 

4、开卷有益（Books）

书，是hidden treasure。上面讲到，要寻找良师，相比书籍而言，良师是活生生的人。但是，有许多伟大的良师已经不复有生命，他们的智慧藏在了书里。

Books you should see as hidden treasure. Think about it, if I told you – because as I said, mentors are great in person, but some of the great mentors are no longer alive – Shakespeare, Darwin, Freud, Mahatma Gandhi. But if I told you all those people were in my house and they’re going to be there this Saturday answering questions, – magically I can make that happen – would you show up at my house? Of course everybody would buy a plane ticket and end up in California. They are there in my house. They’re on my library. They can be in your library, too.

Talking about Sam Walton. This is a man who made $160 billion for himself, more than all the other billionaires, basically, combined. He wrote a book on his death bed. How many people have read it? It’s a tragedy that not every businessperson’s read a $5 book by a man who built an empire. But it’s because the modern education system has turned people off from books. You’ve got to rewire your brain. Let me show you a few quick tricks.

勿要将读书看成是one-time event，而是将书视为朋友，不断地去阅读它。

First thing: stop seeing a book like a one-time event. See a book like a friend. You read it over and over. You come back. And just like friends, you pick a handful of them. I recommend you find 150 books. There’s 130 million. You can’t read that many. But 150 you can read over and over for the rest of your life. There’s no rule, either, at how fast you have to read them, at what pace. I set my own pace. People say, “How do you read a book a day?” Sometimes I take a week. But sometimes, books only have one or two things that are worth reading. In fact, most books only have that.

读书速度可以根据自己的情况来调节。举个例子，可以读三遍：第一遍，只读目录；第二遍，快速浏览；第三遍，找某一章读，就像一个gold miner一样去挖金。

So I’ll flip through the pages. One time I like to go through it three times. First time, I read the table of contents at the back. The second time, I go a little faster. The third time, I just focus on one chapter. See yourself like a gold miner just looking for that one nugget(块金). Then put it back on the shelf.

美国人每年平均读17本书。我们应该一周读一本书。每个人都想过好的生活，但是并不是每个人都愿意通过阅读来获取先人的智慧；如果你读的更多，你也将有更多机会获得别人不知道的智慧。

The average American buys 17 books a year. Maybe reads one a month. You should read at least one book a week, because remember, everybody wants the good life, but not everybody’s willing to read to get it. You must read more.

5、勿要享乐（Stoic versus Epicurean）

坚忍、苦修的人能够放下当前的欢乐去做对未来有益的事情，我们可以说他们是自己未来的投资者（investors）。享乐者活于当下，他们是消费者，他们会说：人只活一次。

One of the first books that I read, this 11-set volume that I got from my grandfather, there was a quote that I wrote down. “A nation is born stoic and dies epicurean.” Stoics(坚忍、苦修的人) were people willing to sacrifice present pleasure for something better later. You could say they were investors. Epicureans（享乐者，爱美食者、享奢华之物的人） live for now. They were consumers. They said, “You only live once.”

有一种说法：走进一间屋子，如果你不知道谁是哪个人是将要被骗的人，那么你就是那个被骗的人。或许你不想成为那个被骗的人，但是请你想想，你看到媒体在做什么，他们投放大量的广告，无非是想卖东西给你。

There’s a saying, “If you’re in a room and you don’t know who the sucker is, you’re the sucker.” You never want to be the sucker. Guess what the media wants to do. I can tell you, I’m from Hollywood. They bombard you. We see on average 2,000 ads a day. They’re trying to sell you something.

奢华是有代价的，可能会消耗你的希望、梦想和雄心壮志。所以要toughen up a little bit，做一个坚忍、苦修之人。

Luxury comes at the cost of killing your hopes, your dreams, your ambitions. So toughen up a little bit. Be a stoic. When was the last time you went a week without eating sugar? Or walked instead of taken a car to get groceries? Or did 100 push-ups? Or turned the air conditioning off? Toughen yourself up. Take a cold shower. You see everybody wants, but not everybody is willing to toughen up to get the good life. You must toughen up.

6、结语

So in closing, I’ll share with you my favorite poem, Chief Tecumseh. He says, “Love your life. Perfect your life. Beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long, and its purpose in the service of your people.” Mentors will help you do that. They are the shortcut that you want. You don’t want to do it the hard way.

Find a mentor, no matter if you’re just starting out or if you’re already experienced. There’s always someone to learn from. You must follow those rules. Be humble. Persevere. Read more. Toughen up. Remember, it’s going to be a little bit hard. It’s like Tom Hanks says in that one movie, “It’s supposed to be hard. The hard is what makes it great.” If you do these things, you will find the good life. Thank you.
